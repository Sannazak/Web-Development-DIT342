## Getting started

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone git@git.ita.chalmers.se:courses/dit341/group-00-web.git

# Change into the directory
cd group-00-web

# Setup backend
cd server && npm install
npm run dev

# Setup frontend
cd client && npm install
npm run serve
```

> Check out the detailed instructions for [backend](./server/README.md) and [frontend](./client/README.md).

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)

Open the `server` and `client` in separate VSCode workspaces or open the combined [backend-frontend.code-workspace](./backend-frontend.code-workspace). Otherwise, workspace-specific settings don't work properly.

## System Definition (MS0)

### Purpose

The system's goal is to make it easier for people interested in surfing, who are travelling or simply trying something new at home, to find surf stores in different locations around Sweden. Users will be able to see all information about the store, surfing gears and surfing lessons the stores have to offer.
It will have a vast library of surf stores, their location and contact information, so that surfers can always find what they need when they are planning their next surf trip. Or when trying a new board on their local surf spot or replacing a broken gear which they need in their next surf session.
The user will be able to create an account so they can add, delete, or change information on the store. They can also mark the stores as favourites which will be displayed at their user profile page.
This system will both help local businesses to get new customers and for surfers to have the freedom to travel without having to bring their own gear.

### Pages

* Home: Landing page showing a map based on your location and newly added stores. Also allows the user to register, login or simply start to navigate through the stores from the store button.
* Search for store: Here it's possible to search for stores based on locations. A button to view the store will direct to the store’s page. An add store button will be activated when the user is logged In.
* Store page: These pages contain the details of the chosen store. Includes contact information, address, services, and gear available, prices and a small description of the store. A button to update or delete the store and to mark it as favourite will be available when the user is logged In.
* Profile page: Here the user can enter their details and preferences. These will later be used to filter for spots and stores.
* Favourite page: This page displays the stores that the user has marked as favourite. The user can click on the view button from the store and be directed to the store’s page.
